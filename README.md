## How to see file history

This monorepo contains projects from different courses.  
Old projects have been developed separately, in different reposietories. Now they 
stay in separate subdirectories, and we have both the commit history and the individual file history for all files.

Since we did a rename, **you have to do `git log –follow <file>` to see that history**, but that’s true for any file rename operation, not just for our repo-merge.
